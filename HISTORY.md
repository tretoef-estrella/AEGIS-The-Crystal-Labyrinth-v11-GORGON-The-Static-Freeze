# AEGIS — Evolution History

## The Journey from Leviathan to Gorgon

### Phase I: Foundation (2025)

**Leviathan (v1–v9.3)** — *The First Beast*
- Operating space: PG(5,4) — 1,365 points, 273 spread lines
- Started as a proof of concept for spread-based obfuscation
- Established the 6 Principles of AEGIS
- Achieved 71-bit security (GL(6,4))
- Final metrics: 38.8% corruption, gap 0.059, 16/18 attacks defended
- Key innovation: Counter-Illumination equalization

**Kraken (v10)** — *The Fishing Net*
- Same space: PG(5,4) — pushed to maximum density
- Introduced biomimetic traps (Vortex, Squid Ink, Glass Frog, Siren Song)
- Introduced the perversity engine (Echo Chamber, Bermuda Triangle, Dead Man's Hand)
- Achieved: 40.4% corruption, gap 0.020, 17/18 attacks defended
- Key innovation: Multi-layer biomimetic corruption + Phantom Tide zones

### Phase II: Scale (2025–2026)

**Kraken OCEAN (v10 PG(11,4))** — *The Deep Migration*
- Scaled from PG(5,4) to PG(11,4) — a 4,096× increase in points
- 5,592,405 points, 1,118,481 spread lines
- Security jumped from 71 bits to 287 bits
- Gap: 0.0084, 10/10 attacks defended
- Key innovation: Streaming architecture for massive projective spaces

### Phase III: Neurotoxic Architecture (February 2026)

**Gorgon v11–v16** — *The Static Freeze*

| Version | Key Change | Gap | Attacks |
|---------|-----------|-----|---------|
| v11 | 6 venoms deployed (Conus→Tetrodotoxin) | 0.0155 | 13/13 |
| v11 R7 | Adversarial audit consensus: cut Chironex, fix Medusa, Frobenius | 0.0053 | 15/15 |
| v12 | +Necrotoxin (Möbius cyclic contradictions) | 0.0076 | 16/16 |
| v13 | Stable build for audit | 0.0076 | 16/16 |
| v14 | +Thanatosis (False Origin) + F1 speed optimization | 0.0045 | 17/17 |
| v15 | +AZAZEL Shuffle + Friendship Paradox + Venom Entropy Audit | 0.0084 | 18/18 |
| **v16** | **FINAL: Seed hardening + ε-jitter + [30] resonance attack** | **0.0008** | **19/19** |

### The Adversarial Audit Process

GORGON was refined through **8 rounds** of multi-AI adversarial auditing:

- **R1–R4**: Internal development, basic attack battery
- **R5**: ChatGPT proposed Spectral Subspace Attack [20], Grok proposed IGCR [21]
- **R6**: Gorgon venoms designed and deployed
- **R7**: Full consensus audit — Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok. Major restructuring:
  - Chironex eliminated (attack surface > stealth gain)
  - Irukandji reduced (4→2 shells)
  - Medusa equipartitioned (root cause of gap)
  - Frobenius in Dendrotoxin (Gemini)
  - Cross-Line Mixing reordered (ChatGPT)
  - Region equalization (Grok)
- **R7.1**: Gemini proposed Necrotoxin and Thanatosis
- **R8**: Final audit — unanimous approval for v16 release

### What Comes Next

**AZAZEL** — *The Living Labyrinth*

The fourth beast in the AEGIS sequence. Where GORGON is the Wall (static, deterministic, verifiable), AZAZEL will be the Labyrinth (dynamic, adaptive, evolving).

The Architect has spoken: *"Terrorífica."*

*"Each code is born from the previous one and evolves it. That is why it is so lethal."*
